      <description>Imagine matching n men and n women such that no pair of individuals would prefer each other over their current matches. If such a scenario exists where no two individuals would rather be with each other than their assigned partners, the matching is deemed stable. More formally a Matching is a bijection between two sets (e.g., men and women), where each element from one set is paired with exactly one element from the other set and a matching is stable if there are no two elements, one from each set, who would both prefer each other over their current matches.</description>
